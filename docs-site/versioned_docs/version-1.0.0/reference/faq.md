## Is docs content bundled for self-hosted installs?

Yes. The docs static build is bundled and served locally at `/docs`.

## Do I need internet access to read docs after deployment?

No, for bundled docs pages.

## How are docs versions managed?

Docs are versioned using Docusaurus versions, intended to map to release tags.

## Where should contributors edit docs?

Edit files under `docs-site/docs` for latest docs.

## Are old markdown files in `documentation/` still canonical?

No. `docs-site/docs` is the source of truth after migration.
